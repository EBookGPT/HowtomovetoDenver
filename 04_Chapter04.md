*Alice in Wonderland Trippy Story*

---

Alice stumbled through the looking glass and found herself in the heart of Denver. As she looked around, she was immediately enchanted by the vibrant mix of people, culture, and scenery. She had never seen anything quite like it before.

Suddenly, a talking rabbit appeared out of nowhere and hopped towards her. "Welcome to Denver, my dear!" he exclaimed. "I see you're new here. Let me show you around."

Alice followed the rabbit as he led her down colorful streets full of bustling activity. He introduced her to all sorts of interesting characters, from cowboy-hat-wearing locals to food-truck vendors serving up brisket croissants.

As Alice walked and talked, she couldn't help but feel a bit overwhelmed. There was so much to take in - the art, the music, the history, the politics - how could she navigate it all?

Just then, they came upon a grandiose building with a sign that read "Mayor John Hickenlooper's Office". The rabbit led her inside and up to the mayor's desk.

"Hello there, Alice," said John Hickenlooper with a friendly smile. "I see you're new to our city. Don't worry, I'm here to help you navigate Denver's cultural landscape."

He then proceeded to hand her a stack of books and pamphlets with information on everything from the city's history to its neighborhoods, parks, and museums. He even gave her a code snippet that would help her find the closest hiking trails.

"Thank you, Mr. Hickenlooper," said Alice gratefully. "This will definitely help me settle in."

As she stepped outside, Alice felt a newfound confidence in her ability to navigate Denver's complexities. With the help of the rabbit and the mayor, she knew she would be able to fully embrace the Mile-High City and all of its wonders.

# Explanation of Code Used to Navigate Denver's Cultural Landscape

In the previous section, we saw Alice stumble through the looking glass and find herself in the heart of Denver. She was introduced to a talking rabbit who showed her around the city and introduced her to interesting characters, including former Colorado Governor and Denver Mayor, John Hickenlooper.

As Mayor Hickenlooper helped Alice navigate Denver's cultural landscape, he provided her with a snippet of code that would help her find the closest hiking trails. Let's explore this code in more detail.

## Code Sample

```python
import requests
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim

def find_hiking_trails(address):
    geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="my_app")
    location = geolocator.geocode(address)
    latitude = location.latitude
    longitude = location.longitude

    response = requests.get(f"https://www.hikingproject.com/data/get-trails?lat={latitude}&lon={longitude}&maxDistance=10&key=YOUR_API_KEY")
    trails = response.json()["trails"]

    if trails:
        return [(trail["name"], trail["summary"]) for trail in trails]
    else:
        return None
```

## Explanation

This code uses the `requests` library to make an API call to the Hiking Project API. The `geopy` library is used to convert a physical address to a latitude and longitude coordinate, which is then used to determine the closest hiking trails within a certain distance.

The `find_hiking_trails` function takes a physical address as a parameter, and returns a list of tuples containing the names and summaries of nearby hiking trails. If no hiking trails are found within the given distance, the function returns `None`.

To use this code, you would need to sign up for a Hiking Project API key and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key in the API call. You would also need to install the `requests` and `geopy` libraries.

So there you have it - with this code snippet, you can easily find nearby hiking trails and explore the beautiful nature that Colorado has to offer. Use it wisely, and happy hiking!
